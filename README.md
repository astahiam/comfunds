## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher
- PostgreSQL 13+
- golang-migrate tool
- Make (optional, for Makefile commands)

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd comfunds
go mod download
```

### 2. Database Setup
Option A - Automatic setup (recommended):
```bash
# Create all sharded databases automatically
make setup-db

# Or create databases + run migrations in one command
make setup-db-complete
```

Option B - Manual setup:
```bash
createdb comfunds00
createdb comfunds01
createdb comfunds02  
createdb comfunds03
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create `.env` file:
```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_SSLMODE=disable

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production

# Server Configuration  
PORT=8080
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations
```bash
# If you used setup-db-complete, skip this step
make migrate-up

# Or manually for each shard:
migrate -path ./migrations -database "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/comfunds00?sslmode=disable" up
migrate -path ./migrations -database "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/comfunds01?sslmode=disable" up
migrate -path ./migrations -database "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/comfunds02?sslmode=disable" up
migrate -path ./migrations -database "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/comfunds03?sslmode=disable" up
```

### 5. Build and Run
```bash
# Using Makefile
make build && make dev

# Or directly
go run main.go
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### 6. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health

# Should return shard health status
```

## üß™ Testing

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Run all unit tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage report  
make test-coverage

# Run tests with race detection
make test-race

# Run integration tests (requires TEST_INTEGRATION=1)
make test-integration

# Run all tests (unit + integration)
make test-all
```

### Manual Test Commands
```bash
# Unit tests only
go test ./internal/... -v

# All tests with coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./internal/...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# Integration tests (requires database setup)
TEST_INTEGRATION=1 go test -v ./...
```
